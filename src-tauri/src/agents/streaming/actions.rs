//! Side effects emitted by the state machine in `streaming/state.rs`.
//!
//! Each `handle_*(state, event) -> Vec<Action>` call returns the list of
//! external effects (DB writes, frontend emits, sidecar requests) that
//! the loop should execute. Returning a list instead of executing the
//! effects inline lets us:
//!
//! - Unit-test the state machine without DB or Tauri channels.
//! - Express ordering invariants explicitly (the list IS the order —
//!   the Update emit must precede the terminal Done/Aborted/etc. so the
//!   frontend cache is up-to-date when the spinner clears).
//! - Catch missing effects via the test fixtures — if a transition was
//!   meant to emit `EmitToFrontend(Done)` but doesn't, the snapshot
//!   diff is impossible to miss.
//!
//! Today only `EmitToFrontend` and `PersistContextUsage` are wired into
//! [`apply_action`]. The remaining variants (`PersistTurnRange`,
//! `PersistResult`, `PersistError`, `PersistExitPlan`,
//! `AdoptProviderSessionId`, `RequestSidecarStop`,
//! `FinalizeSessionStatus`) are reserved for a future iteration that
//! moves the inline DB-write loops in `streaming/mod.rs` behind the
//! Action interface; the catch-all arm in `apply_action` logs them so
//! a state-machine test that emits an unwired action fails loudly.

// Reserved Action variants are wired in across the persistence-side
// migration; suppress dead-code warnings until each migrates.
