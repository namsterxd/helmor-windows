3. Commit with a concise, Conventional-Commits-style message (\`feat:\`, \`fix:\`, \`refactor:\`, \`chore:\`, etc.) that summarizes the change in one line.
4. Push the current branch to its remote. If needed, create the remote tracking branch with \`git push -u <remote> HEAD\`.
5. Open a pull request against the repository's default branch using \`gh pr create\`. Use a clear PR title and a body that explains: what changed, why it changed, and any follow-up / test notes.
