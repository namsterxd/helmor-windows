Do the following, in order:

2. Stage everything that should ship with \`git add\`.
3. Commit with a concise, Conventional-Commits-style message (\`feat:\`, \`fix:\`, \`refactor:\`, \`chore:\`, etc.) that summarizes the change in one line.
4. Push the current branch to its remote. If needed, create the remote tracking branch with \`git push -u <remote> HEAD\`.
5. Open a pull request against the repository's default branch using \`gh pr create\`. Use a clear PR title and a body that explains: what changed, why it changed, and any follow-up / test notes.
6. Report the PR URL in your final message so I can click it.

Do the following, in order:

2. Identify the root cause — don't just paper over the symptom. Explain your diagnosis briefly before making changes.
3. Apply the minimum set of changes needed to get CI green. Run the relevant tests / linters locally to confirm.
4. Commit the fix with a clear \`fix(ci): …\` message and push to the same branch so CI re-runs.
5. Report what was broken, what you changed, and whether the re-run is passing.`,

Do the following, in order:
1. Identify the target branch (usually \`main\` or \`master\` — check the repo's default branch).
2. Fetch the latest target branch from its remote, then rebase or merge it into the current branch.
3. Resolve each conflict, preserving intent from both sides where possible. Explain your resolution choices briefly in the session.
4. Run the relevant tests locally to confirm nothing broke.
5. Commit the resolution and push.
6. Report the conflicted files and how you resolved them.
