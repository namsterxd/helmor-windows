/**
 * Drive the macOS Dock badge from the sidebar's workspace groups query cache.
 *
 * The badge count equals the unread quantity currently visible in the sidebar
 * query cache (summed across every non-archived workspace). When the count
 * drops to 0 we clear the badge by passing `undefined` to `setBadgeCount`.
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - Read-only against the existing `workspaceGroups` query — no new IPC, no new
 *   event subscription, no mutation of cached data. Every path that already
 *   invalidates this query (opening a workspace, window focus refetch, unread
 *   mutations) drives the badge automatically.
 * - Errors are swallowed so the badge call can never take down the renderer —
 *   on Windows the API is a no-op failure and we intentionally ignore it.
 * - Mount this once at the app shell. It renders nothing.
